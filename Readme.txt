MAL Updater OS X 2.1 Cocoa

To use, launch MAL Updater OS X. Go to the MAL Updater OS X icon on the menu bar and Preferences. Save your login info (encoded in Base64 in Preferences) and click Start Scrobbling.

To compile, make sure you have these frameworks on your computer.
CMrashReporter.framework
Sparkle.framework (GC Version)
OgreKit.framework
Growl.framework
JSON.framework
BWToolkitFramework.framework

You may need to find the directory where these frameworks are since they are on a different location on my computer.
